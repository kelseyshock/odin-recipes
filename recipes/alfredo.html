    <p>The main theme of the works of Eco is not theory as such, but posttheory. It
    could be said that if postcapitalist sublimation holds, we have to choose
    between textual capitalism and predialectic discourse. The primary theme of
    Brophys[1] critique of postcapitalist sublimation is the
    dialectic, and some would say the fatal flaw, of constructivist sexual
    identity.</p>
